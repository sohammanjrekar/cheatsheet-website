# Becoming a Free Lance Web Developer

## 1.1 Questions to do before the project

-   What is the website about?
-   Is there a website whose design you like?
-   When is the project expected to be delivered? (**DELIVER ON TIME,
    REJECT OTHERWISE**)
-   Do you have a budget?
-   Do you want custom coding or use of a CMS?
-   Will there be training? (Train the client to use CMS)
-   Do you have a domain name & hosting already?
-   Do you have a logo?

## 1.2 Sample Proposal

Use the template Review point 3 in the Next Steps section and also the
second paragraph in the Terms and conditions section in the video

## 1.3 Revision Process

You can agree a revision in 10 - 20 hours, at the middle of the project,
etc. Make sure at the beginning they have approved the design.

## 1.4 Working with a designer

If you can\'t design a website (graphically) you will work with a
graphic designer, you need to clarify all of your questions.

## 1.5 How to over deliver a project?

Give yourself more time than necessary, you\'ll finish before, of course
this doesn\'t apply in urgent requests. Be proactive, propose solutions.
Enfatize savings in time and money Offer aditional material that will
help them with their business.

## 1.6 Charging

In any case the fee is per work done, if the client wants also to add a
domain name and a hosting a extra fee should be charged. It is
convenient to upload the site to a test site so the client can see it
working, and then upload it to the permanent hosting.

-   Per hour
-   Per flat rate
-   Retainer

### 1.6.1 Per hour

Not recommended if you\'re new, because the client doesn\'t know how
good you are. Except when you\'re modifying a small part of a project.
Warning: When you choose an hourly rate you will probably not be able to
increase the hourly rate later, take in account the number of hours.

### 1.6.2 Per flat rate

The best option

### 1.6.3 Retainer

When the client needs monthly mainteinment

## 1.8 How to charge your clients the right way

Offer three different packages to a prospective client. So the client
spend the more he is willing to pay.

## 1.9 Payments

Pay half at the beginning and half at the end. You can also use 1/3 or
1/4. Do not take on any project without a upfront payment, **NEVER
EVER**. Always **make sure you got control over the domain name and web
hosting**, so you can protect yourself in the case they don\'t pay you.
